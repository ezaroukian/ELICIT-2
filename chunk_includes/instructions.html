<h1> Instructions </h1>

<p><b>Your role</b>: Intelligence Analyst	</p>

<p><b>Your mission</b>:  New intelligence information shows increased activity among potential terror groups.  Your role is to uncover the details of a fictitious terror plot.  You will receive intelligence information in the form of a series of sentences that will help you uncover the details of the terror plot.</p>

<p> Be on the lookout for four types of information:
<ul>
	<li><b>WHO</b>: Information regarding the name of the <b>GROUP</b> planning the attack
	<ul><li>Possible relevant sentence: <i>The Sphere group is not involved.</i></li>
	<li>Note: Individuals may also be mentioned, but all and only group names will be followed by the word "group"</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>WHAT</b>: Descriptions of the <b>TARGET</b> of the attack
	<ul><li>Possible relevant sentence:  <i>A new airport is being built in the country of Lemurland.</i></li></ul></li>
	<li><b>WHERE</b>: Descriptions of the <b>COUNTRY</b> in which the attack will take place
	<ul><li>Possible relevent sentence:  <i>The Cube and Sphere groups have the capacity to operate in Lemurland. </i></li>
	<li>Note: Countries will always end in “land”</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>WHEN</b>: Information regarding the <b>MONTH</b>, <b>DAY</b>, and <b>HOUR</b> that the attack will occur
	<ul><li>Possible relevant sentence:  <i>The attack will be at 11:00.</i></li></ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> Once you have used this information to piece together the “who”, “what”, “where”, and “when” of the attack, <b>select your answers from provided dropdown menus</b>.</p>

<p> The sentences you are shown may contain <b>markup</b> that has been automatically generated and is intended to help you extract relevant information. While it is intended to be helpful, the markup may not be entirely correct. </p> 

<p><b>Please work as quickly as you can without sacrificing accuracy.</b>  You will have 20 minutes to uncover each terrorist plot, and a countdown clock will be provided on screen. You will be presented with a total of two scenarios. Feel free to take a break after submitting your answers for one scenario and before beginning the next one.</p>

<!--<p>[You may use the blank sheet of paper provided to make any notes about the scenario or solution.]</p>-->



<p>Before the experiment begins, you will be shown a training scenario.</p>
