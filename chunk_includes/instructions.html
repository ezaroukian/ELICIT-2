<h1> Instructions </h1>

<p><b>Your role</b>: Intelligence Analyst	</p>

<p><b>Your mission</b>:  New intelligence information shows increased activity among potential terror groups.  Your role is to uncover the details of a fictitious terror plot.  You will receive intelligence information in the form of a series of sentences that will help you uncover the details of the terror plot.</p>

<p> Be on the lookout for four types of information:
<ul>
	<li><b>WHO</b>: Information regarding the name of the <b>GROUP</b> planning the attack
	<ul><li>Possible relevant sentence: <i>The Sphere group is not involved.</i></li>
	<li>Note: Individuals may also be mentioned, but all and only group names will be followed by the word "group"</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>WHAT</b>: Descriptions of the <b>TARGET</b> of the attack
	<ul><li>Possible relevant sentence:  <i>A new airport is being built in the country of Bonoboland.</i></li></ul></li>
	<li><b>WHERE</b>: Descriptions of the <b>COUNTRY</b> in which the attack will take place
	<ul><li>Possible relevant sentence:  <i>The Cylinder and Sphere groups have the capacity to operate in Bonoboland. </i></li>
	<li>Note: Countries will always end in “land”</li></ul></li>
	<li><b>WHEN</b>: Information regarding the <b>MONTH</b>, <b>DAY</b>, and <b>HOUR</b> that the attack will occur
	<ul><li>Possible relevant sentence:  <i>The attack will be at 11:00.</i></li></ul></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> Once you have used this information to piece together the “who”, “what”, “where”, and “when” of the attack, <b>select your answers from provided dropdown menus</b>.</p>

<p> The sentences you are shown may contain <b>highlighting</b> that has been automatically generated and is intended to help you extract relevant information. While it is intended to be helpful, the highlighting may not be entirely correct. </p> 

<p><b>Please work as quickly as you can without sacrificing accuracy.</b>  You will have 20 minutes to uncover each terrorist plot, and a countdown clock will be provided on screen. You will be presented with a total of two scenarios. Feel free to take a break after submitting your answers for one scenario and before beginning the next one.</p>

<!--<p>[You may use the blank sheet of paper provided to make any notes about the scenario or solution.]</p>-->



<p>Before the experiment begins, you will be shown two training scenarios. The first will not contain any highlighting. The second will contain automatically generated highlighting intended to help you extract relevant information.</p>
